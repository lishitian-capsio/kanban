// Intentionally perform PATH inspection in-process instead of spawning `which`, `where`,
// `command -v`, or an interactive shell.
//
// Why this exists:
// Kanban is launched from the user's shell and inherits that shell's environment, including
// PATH and exported variables. For agent detection and other startup-time capability checks,
// the question we care about is "can the current Kanban process directly execute this binary
// from its inherited environment?" A direct PATH scan answers exactly that question.
//
// Why we do not delegate to shell commands:
// 1. Spawning helper commands like `which` or `where` adds unnecessary subprocess overhead
//    to hot paths such as loading runtime config.
// 2. Falling back to `zsh -ic 'command -v ...'` or similar is much worse because it can
//    trigger full interactive shell startup. On machines with heavy shell init like `conda`
//    or `nvm`, doing that repeatedly per task or per config read can freeze the runtime and
//    even make new terminal windows feel hung while the machine is saturated.
// 3. Depending on external lookup commands is also less robust than inspecting PATH directly.
//    For example, detection should not depend on `which` itself being available on PATH.
//
// Why this is acceptable:
// If a binary is only available after re-running shell init files, Kanban should treat it as
// unavailable for task-agent startup. That keeps behavior predictable and aligned with the
// environment the Kanban process already has, instead of silently relying on hidden shell
// side effects.
/**
 * Resolves the absolute filesystem path Kanban would actually execute for the
 * given binary, by scanning the inherited `$PATH` exactly the way
 * {@link isBinaryAvailableOnPath} does — returning the resolved path instead of
 * a boolean. An absolute/relative path resolves to itself when accessible; a
 * bare name resolves to the first matching `$PATH` entry (with `PATHEXT`
 * candidates on Windows). Returns `null` when nothing executable is found.
 *
 * Like its boolean sibling this is an in-process, synchronous PATH scan
 * (`fs.accessSync`) — deliberately NOT a `which`/`where` subprocess — so it is
 * safe on the config-load hot path.
